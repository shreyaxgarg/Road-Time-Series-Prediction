# Road-Time-Series-Prediction
This project predicts the parameters for time series data of IoT sensors deployed on roads.

<h2>Objective</h2>
The objective of this repository is to predict values of parameter 9-13 from the given road dataset for every section.

<h2>Model Used</h2>
The model used for this project is Light Gradient Boosting Machine.

<h2>Methodolgy</h2>
Transformed the Data into Train and Test Dataset, by extracting 10th year data for para 9-13 for every section. Applied the ML model to make the necessary predictions.

<h2>Results</h2>
RMSE VALUE of model is 68.76256
